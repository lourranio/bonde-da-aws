### FIZ E DEU MUITO BOM, OBSERVAÇÕES DO EXAME:

Interpretação de texto é 70% do exame.

Afinidade com EC2 (Autoscaling, AMI, Características), VPC (Endpoints, RouteTable, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Subnets, NACLs, Security Groups), S3 (Versionamento, Replicação, Classes de Armazenamento) e EBS (IOPS, Tipos, Backup). Para boa parte das soluções esses caras são base.

**Oq mais caiu:**

- soluções com CloudFront + S3, sites estáticos (caiu umas 10 questões nessa temática)
- S3, versionamento, classes de armazenamento, transfer acceleration
- AutoScaling
- Muita pegadinha com ECS, EKS e FareGate.
- Muita pegadinha com ECS, EKS e FareGate.

**Outros temas importantes para ficarem afiados:**

- AWS Glue e Kinesis (Kinesis aparece bastante quando o assunto é streaming de dados)
- Beanstalk
- Route53 (Failover, Latency and Geo policies)
- Storages (Storage Gateway (VTL, Volumes e NFS), DataSync, EBS)
- DirectConnect
- RDS (tipos de disponibilidade), como criptografar um RDS que foi criado sem cripto.
- E atenção nos limites do Lambda, cai bastante questão que o Lambda parece ser a melhor opção, mas as especificações param nos limites.
